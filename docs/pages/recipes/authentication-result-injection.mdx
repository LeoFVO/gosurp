description: 'Recipe: Authentication results injection'

Another vector for potential ambiguity arises from how results
are communicated from one component to another.  
The presence of meta-characters in the communication introduces the
possibility of "results injection" analogous to SQL or command injection.

## Authentication result header syntax

This threat depends on the details of how SPF and DKIM components
forward their authentication results to DMARC components to enable it
to perform its alignment check on the value of the From header.  
RFC 8601 defines the Authentication-Results header to provide a common
framework for communicating these authentication results, for example:

```text
Authentication-Results: example.com; spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=sender@sender.com; dkim=pass (1024-bit key) reason="signature ok" header.d=sender.com;
```

Here, "spf=pass" and "dkim=pass" indicate that the message passed both
SPF and DKIM verification for the mail server for example.com.  
"smtp.mailfrom" represents the domain verified by the SPF component,
and "header.d" represents the domain verified by the DKIM component.  
The text in parentheses reflect a comment.  
The DMARC component parses this header to extract the SPF/DKIM
authentication results and check
whether the tested value align with the domain in the From header.

## Authentication results injection attacks

A vulnerability arises because an attacker can control the domain name
embedded in the "header.d" and "smtp.mailfrom" fields.
The flexibility of domain-name syntax provides fertile ground
for attackers to construct malformed domain names.
Although many applications require domain names to follow specific
syntax rules—for example, domain name registrars only allow users to
register domain names under the LDH rules (only letters, digits, hyphens)
—the DNS protocol does not impose any restrictions on the characters in
a domain label.  
In particular, an attacker can introduce malformed domains that include
meta-characters, for example "a.com(.b.com". SPF and DKIM components
may treat those characters as data, while DMARC components may parse
them as control information.  
We found two types of injection attacks based on such malformed domains.

### DKIM authentication results injection

Attackers can generate DKIM-Signature headers using their own private
keys, with "d=" values that embed a literal open parenthesis, such
as "legitimate.com(.attacker.com".
When receiving this message, the DKIM component queries
"selector.\_domainkey.legitimate.com(. attacker.com" — a domain
under the attacker's control — to obtain the DKIM public key to verify
the message.
The DKIM component then generates:

```text
Authentication-results: victim.com ; dkim=pass (1024-bit key ) header.d=legitimate.com(.attacker.com;
```

When receiving the Authentication-Results header, the DMARC component
parses "header.d" as legitimate.com, because it parses the content
after the "(" as a comment. Since the "header.d" value matches the From
header domain, the attacker's message passes DMARC verification.
Along with "(", double (") and single (') quote characters can also
work for this technique.  
Because RFC 5322 defines characters within the quotes as atoms, DMARC
modules may parse the content after the quote as part of the atom.

### SPF authentication results injection

Similarly, an attacker can craft malformed addresses in MAIL FROM
commands to bypass SPF and DMARC verification.
The SPF component verifies the attacker controlled domain
"legitimate.com(.attacker.com", while the DMARC module takes the first
half of the domain for the alignment test.
We found that some mail servers perform a degree of validation on the
MAIL FROM address's syntax, and reject the above address.
But attackers can bypass their validation. Here, the mail server takes
the second "@" as the delimiter, and recognizes it as a valid email
address, while the SPF component takes the first "@" as the delimiter,
and thus queries "legitimate.com'@a.attack.com" — the attacker's
domain—to verify the sending IP address.  
When the DMARC component parses the authentication results, it takes
the content after the single quote as a quoted string, and uses
legitimate.com for the alignment test.
