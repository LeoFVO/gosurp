Inconsistencies can also arise between authentication components and DNS components: what the authentication component verifies differs from what the DNS component queries.  
An attacker can craft ambiguous domains to make the authentication component believe that it's verifying the legitimate domain, but the DNS component actually queries the attacker's domain to obtain policy records.

The authentication component generates "pass" authentication results because the attacker controls the policy retrieved via DNS.

## NUL ambiguity

One way to craft such domains uses the NUL ("\x00") character, which terminate strings in some languages (e.g., C) but not in others (e.g., Perl or PHP).

For example, we can fool Gmail.com using this technique.
Gmail's DKIM and DNS components differ in interpreting NULs in domain name.  
First the attacker constructs a fake email with arbitrary email content.  
They then sign the message with their own private DKIM key to generate the DKIM-Signature header, which specifies the "d=" tag as legitimate.com and the â€˜s=' tag as "attacker.com.\x00.any".

```bash
gosurp smtp send -vvv --from someone@legitimate.com --to victim@localhost --dkim-domain legitimate.com --dkim-key ./private.key --dkim-selector "attack.com.\x00.any._domainkey.legitimate.com"
```

_NOTE: You need to provide a valide private key matching the public one available on your domain._

When the Gmail server receives the email, its DKIM component queries the domain s.\_domainkey.d, i.e., "attack.com.\x00.any.\_domainkey.legitimate.com", to obtain the public key.

But when it invokes to resolve this domain, the DNS component parses the NUL character as a string terminator and instead obtains the public key from attack.com.

The DKIM component thus uses the attacker's public key to verify the forged message, erroneously believing that the legitimate domain correctly signed the message.  
The spoofed message also passes Gmail's DMARC verification because the "d=" domain is identical to the From header domain.
