SMTP employs two different identifiers — HELO and MAIL
FROM — to represent the email sender who transmits a message. The SPF standard (RFC 7208) states that SPF verifiers
should check both; checking MAIL FROM is mandatory, and
HELO is recommended. The DMARC standard (RFC 7489)
states that DMARC verifiers should use the MAIL FROM
identity to perform the alignment test to validate the identity
in the From header. If the MAIL FROM address is empty, the
verifier should use the HELO identity.
This design introduces the possibility that different components might authenticate different identifiers. When the SPF
component cannot verify the MAIL FROM address, but can
verify the HELO identifier, the DMARC component might
still use the MAIL FROM identifier for its alignment test. We
developed two techniques to exploit these possibilities:

## Non-existent subdomains.

The first technique crafts a MAIL FROM domain as a non-existent
subdomain of a legitimate domain.
SPF components cannot verify the MAIL FROM address because the non-existent
domain doesn't have any SPF policy. Some SPF implementations
(e.g., Python-postfix-policyd-spf) will then only verify
the HELO identifier, forwarding a "pass" result because the
HELO domain is under the attacker's control. Some DMARC
implementations (e.g., OpenDMARC), however, still use the
MAIL FROM domain to perform the alignment test with the
From header, because the MAIL FROM address is not empty.
Doing so subverts the DMARC authentication because both
the SPF check and the DMARC alignment test show positive
results.

```bash
gosurp smtp send --hostname "attacker-domain.com" --from "attacker@invalid-subdomain.usurped-domain.com" --to "victim@target.com" --body "Your email body" --subject "Your email subject"
```

## "Empty" MAIL FROM addresses.

The second technique exploits differences in how components treat an empty
MAIL FROM address.  
(Note that in the example, the left parenthesis is deliberately left unclosed.)  
Some SPF implementations treat "(any@legitimate.com" as an
empty MAIL FROM address, and thus forward the results
of checking HELO to the DMARC component, because the
string in the parentheses can be parsed as a comment according to RFC 5322.  
Some DMARC implementations, however, may take it as a normal non-empty address, and use
its domain for the alignment test.

```bash
gosurp smtp send --from "(any@legitimate.com" --to "victim@target.com" --body "Your email body" --subject "Your email subject"
```
