GoSurp is a cli tool to work on email and DNS usurpation. It is written in Go and is distributed as a single binary without any external dependencies.

```bash
gosurp -h
```

This will display help for the tool. Here are all the switches it supports.

### Inspect DNS Record

First of all, Gosurp allow you to inpect DNS records.

```bash
gosurp inspect domain <yourdomain.com>
```

You can also look for specific DNS records using:

```bash
gosurp inspect (spf/dkim/dmarc) <yourdomain.com>
```

### Email usurpation

First of all, to allow you working on building the good mail without sending it, you can use the following command to start a local SMTP server that will print the mail content in the console like a debugger.

```bash
gosurp smtp listen -vvv
# or
gosurp smtp listen --hostname localhost --port 2525 -vvv
```

Then, you can use the following command to send a mail using the local SMTP server.

```bash
gosurp smtp send -vvv --from attacker@fsociety.local --to victim@localhost --port 2525
```
