## Binary Releases

We are now shipping binaries for each of the releases so that you don't even have to build them yourself! How wonderful is that!

If you're stupid enough to trust binaries that I've put together, you can download them from the [releases](https://github.com/LeoFVO/gosurp/releases) page.

## Using `go install`

If you have a [Go](https://golang.org/) environment ready to go (at least go 1.19), it's as easy as:

```bash
go install github.com/LeoFVO/gosurp@latest
```

PS: You need at least go 1.19 to compile gosurp.

## Using Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/leofvo/gosurp:latest
docker run gosurp:latest
```

## Building From Source

### Prerequisites

Since this tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) you need to install the Go language/compiler/etc. Full details of installation and set up can be found [on the Go language website](https://golang.org/doc/install). Once installed you have two options. You need at least go 1.19 to compile gosurp.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LeoFVO/gosurp.git
```

### Compiling

`gosurp` has external dependencies, and so they need to be pulled in first:

```bash
go get && go build
```

This will create a `gosurp` binary for you. If you want to install it in the `$GOPATH/bin` folder you can run:

```bash
go install
```
