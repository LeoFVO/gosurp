# Simple Mail Transfert Protocol (SMTP)

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) provides an Internet
standard for mail transmission [2]. Figure 2 shows the three
main steps to deliver an email message. Alice's email is first
transmitted to her service provider via her mail user agent
(MUA). The sending service then sends it to Bob's service
provider using SMTP. The message is then delivered to Bob's
MUA via IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP
(Post Office Protocol).

## SMTP Lack authentication

SMTP's original specification lacked mechanisms to authenticate the sender's identity, enabling any
Internet host to impersonate another's identity by sending
spoofed emails. In practice, attackers usually exploit SMTP
by running their own email servers or clients.
SMTP's design includes multiple "identities" when handling messages. Both the MAIL FROM and From headers
identify the email sender, but they have different meanings
in an SMTP conversation. The first represents the user who
transmitted the message, and is usually not displayed to the
recipient. The second represents the user who composed the
message, and is visible to the recipient.
In addition, SMTP introduces multiple other sender identities, such as the HELO command, Sender and Resent-From
headers. Nothing in the design enforces consistencies among
these. Thus, the design poses a basic question for any authentication mechanism: which identity to authenticate?

## Preventing spoofing

To combat email forgery, various email authentication mechanisms have been developed, including SPF, DKIM,
DMARC, BIMI, and ARC .

### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) allows a domain
owner to publish DNS records to specify which servers are
allowed to send emails for the domain. A mail server receiving a message first queries any domain present in the MAIL
FROM and—recommended, but not required—HELO commands, to obtain the SPF policy, and then checks whether the
sender's IP address matches the policy. If either HELO or
MAIL FROM check fails, the mail server enforces the policy
specified by domain owner (e.g., hard fail, soft fail) to reject
the message
One major problem of SPF is incompatibility with mail
forwarders. When an email is forwarded, SPF checks can fail
because SPF components authenticate the forwarding server,
rather than the original sending server.

### DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) uses cryptography to authenticate senders and protect email integrity.
The general idea behind DKIM is to let senders sign parts of
messages so that receivers can validate them. When sending a
message, the sending mail server generates a DKIM-Signature
header using its private key and attaches it to the message.
When the destination server receives the email, it queries the
domain in the d= field of the DKIM-Signature header to obtain
the signer's public key, and verifies the DKIM signature's
validity.

```text
DKIM - Signature: v =1; a=rsa - sha256 ; c= relaxed /
relaxed ; d= example . com ; s= selector ; h=
From:To:Subject ; l =200; bh = I8iwjsTG /
djENwF0HjjQSgUtWKv5izitR9 + mDu1ambA =; b=
HA1a66oMfyVbQwZLd3Dkm3ZDfomVU1FgMF ...
```

The above shows an example of a DKIM-Signature header.
The important tags for our work include:

- d represents the signer's domain.
- s stands for selector, which permits multiple
  keys under the "d=" domain for fine-grained
  signatory control. The tag is used to obtain
  the public key by querying "s.\_domainkey.d"
  (selector.\_domainkey.example.com here).
- h represents the list of headers covered by the signature.
- l is an optional tag giving the length of the message
  body covered by the signature.

Unfortunately, neither SPF nor DKIM provides a complete
solution for preventing email spoofing. SPF authenticates the
HELO/MAIL FROM identifier and DKIM authenticates the d=
field in DKIM-signature header: neither of them authenticates
the From header displayed to the end-user, which means that
even if an email passes SPF and DKIM validation, its From
address can still be forged.

### Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting & Confidence (DMARC)

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) is designed to fix this final
trust problem by building on SPF and DKIM. When receiving
a message, the receiving mail server queries the domain in
the From header to obtain its DMARC policy, which specifies
what the receiver should do with the incoming email. The
receiving server performs an identifier alignment test to check
whether the domain in the From header matches the domain
name verified by SPF or DKIM. The alignment test has two
modes: strict and relaxed. In strict mode, the From header domain needs to exactly match the SPF or DKIM-authenticated
identifier. In relaxed mode (default mode), it only need to
have the same registered domain. If either SPF or DKIM
indicates a positive result, and the From domain passes the
alignment test, the email passes DMARC authentication. This
design provides more robustness, for example, for forwarded
emails: SPF may fail, but DKIM will survive. If both fail, the
server will enforce the DMARC policy specified by the domain owners, such as rejecting the email and sending failure
reports.

## Summary

Combining these three mechanisms, an email system ensures that the address in the From header cannot be forged,
and prevents email forgery.
